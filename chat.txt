so nginx is a webserver that reads the configuration and then it has a master and that master manages workers right? 
and those workers use shared socket?


Exactly! You got it.

### To recap and clarify:

* **`event.events`** is where you specify **what kind of events you want to monitor** on a file descriptor.

  Examples of event types you can monitor:

  * `EPOLLIN` — data available to read (input)
  * `EPOLLOUT` — ready for writing (output)
  * `EPOLLERR` — error condition happened
  * `EPOLLHUP` — hang up (e.g., closed connection)
  * `EPOLLET` — enable **edge-triggered** behavior (more efficient but tricky)
  * etc.

### What you wrote:

> *"events it's any event like literally any"*

Not quite — you choose the event types you're interested in. If you want to catch **any event**, you could combine flags with a bitwise OR like:

```c
event.events = EPOLLIN | EPOLLOUT | EPOLLERR | EPOLLHUP;
```

But usually, you only monitor the specific events you care about to avoid unnecessary wake-ups.

### Why do we need this `event` structure?

* Because epoll supports monitoring **many different file descriptors** for **many different kinds of events** at once.
* Each `event` struct tells epoll:

  * **Which file descriptor** (stored in `event.data.fd`)
  * **Which events** to watch for (stored in `event.events`)

So yes — **you create and configure this `event` struct to tell epoll exactly what to watch for on a given FD.**

If you want, I can explain more about these event types or how to use them for common cases!
